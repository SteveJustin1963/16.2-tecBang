 
Investigate Bit Bang Serial for the TEC-1, no UART, only latch
 
termnal > ascii > ttl > latch > bit/time/loop > byte > hex or ascii > code


bit bang code plus an uploader, via virtual serial port. 
Can add UART chip to TEC-1 later. 
Therefore enter small amount of code via hex keypad to run bitbang serial and intel hex transfer.
 
examples  
* Southern Cross Computer (tec-1 clone)
* tec_times 1990, serial loader
* bitbang from http://www.ganssle.com/articles/auart.htm
* rs2014
