Hardware soldered up in a night. Now to steal/hack/code the software for the BitBang Serial Interface.
74ls244 along with an EPROM to hold the code.

The story is that there are a few options out there to do serial comms (Ben and Brian come to mind) but all use bigger or complex chips when to do serial, as I proved to myself the interface to the MAX7219 chip, isn’t that hard and only needs minimal c… See More

You are using the 7219 to drive 8x8 or using it as a serial to parallel converter?

Scott Gregory didn’t know you can use it as a serial to parallel converter! No, I made drive an 8x8 module. I put a post of it working in here.

Ah! That makes sense then. That works to bit bang. Ben's board, and others, are more for 8N1 Serial, eg 10 bit packets.

would you use 74ls244 and 373 interchangably ?

Stephen Justin very good question and I’m about to find out with this mod and Ken’s new board which uses a 373.

i also got the feeling 272 cant handle bitbang

Stephen Justin I’m certainly no expert on this, but someone commented on my TEC+lcD schematic that a latch is not appropriate for input on the bus, that it should be a buffer. And after thinking about it (but not claiming it is gospel)... a latch will … See More

A latch can be used so long as it is tri-state. If you look at the 373's truth table, if output control is high then the latch outputs all go high impedance. The results of not going Hi-Z to free up the bus ranges from an outright crash of the Z80 to … See More

The difference between using a 373 and a 244 here is that when the 373 is addressed, the data is held stable during the read. With a 244, the data may change during the read, resulting in goodness knows what.

Stephen Justin Jim was bitbanging with a 373 in the DAT/JMON. the 373 is a tristate buffer with the ability to hold the data if desired. It is not an edge triggered latch like the 273.
